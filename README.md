# GraphDB Using Neo4j
## Create GraphDB Representing HP Printer Entities

A graph database, also known as a graph-oriented database or graph data store, is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships between data. In a graph database, data is represented in the form of nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between these entities.

###A simple example is shown below

Graph databases are designed to handle complex and highly interconnected data, making them particularly useful for applications such as social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, among others. They can provide more natural and efficient ways of querying data compared to traditional relational databases, which use tables and rows to store and organize information.

Popular graph databases include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB.
